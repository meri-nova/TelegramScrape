# TelegramScrape


This bot scrapes first messages in a telegram group chat and creates a table with sender, date, message, links. 
It was created to find first introductory messages of a large group chat, to easily get participants information.



First enter your personal api_id, api_hash, phone number and username in the credentials.txt file. 


## Obtaining api_id
In order to obtain an API id and develop your own application using the Telegram API you need to do the following:

Sign up for Telegram using any application.
Log in to your Telegram core: https://my.telegram.org.
Go to "API development tools" and fill out the form.
You will get basic addresses as well as the api_id and api_hash parameters required for user authorization.
For the moment each number can only have one api_id connected to it.

Input those values in the credentials.txt before running the main.py file. 

## Running the bot 

The main file is located in main.py. 

It is recommended to start a virtual environment to run the code.
